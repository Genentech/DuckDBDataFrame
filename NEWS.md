# DuckDBDataFrame 0.9.22

## Internal changes

- Reworked DuckDB extension handling toward a plug-and-play experience.
  Connections no longer eagerly `INSTALL` `spatial`/`httpfs` from the public CDN
  on every connect (which made an optional, spatial-only concern everyone's
  problem). Instead `acquireDuckDBConn()` now:
  - enables DuckDB **autoloading**, so extensions are fetched and loaded on first
    use of a function that needs them;
  - honors an optional **internal extension mirror** for restricted networks via
    `MODL_DUCKDB_EXTENSION_REPOSITORY` (or the DuckDB-native
    `DUCKDB_EXTENSION_REPOSITORY`);
  - eagerly `LOAD`s only extensions **already present** in the extension directory
    (a local, offline-safe operation), so a pre-provisioned or air-gapped cache
    just works.
- As a result, non-spatial workflows no longer make any network attempt for
  extensions on connect. `loadExtension()` is retained as a helper for explicit
  or vendored loading.

# DuckDBDataFrame 0.9.21

## Documentation

- Restructured the vignettes into a user-first set:
  *Introduction to DuckDBDataFrame* (motivation, construction, and the common
  operations) and *Design and extension of DuckDBDataFrame* (the `DuckDBTable`
  abstraction, SQL translation, connection model, and extension points, for
  developers).
- Rewrote the README.

## Internal changes

- Install and load DuckDB extensions into a writable extension directory
  (honoring `DUCKDB_EXTENSION_DIRECTORY`), so extension use works on shared or
  read-only R libraries; optional extensions degrade gracefully.
- Minor code-style cleanups flagged by `BiocCheck`: replaced `sapply()` with
  `setNames(lapply(...))` where names must be preserved, used `seq_len()` in
  place of `1:n`, and tidied condition-signal messages.
